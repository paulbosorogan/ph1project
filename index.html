                <p>Hi! My name is Paul and this is my foodie blog. Long story short, ever since I was a child I was drawn to the kitchen and food. But only during university this curiosity became a necessity and then eventually it became a new hobby. I love cooking! It relaxes me. Below you'll see a few options I selected for meal ideas. Hope you enjoy!
