Add salt, pepper and the lime juice and smash with a fork until your desired consistency. In a small pot add water and one tablespoon of vinegar and warm it up. Do not bring it up to a boil! You want the water to be warm but not too hot. In order to avoid egg shells or broken yolks, crack the eggs in idividual bowls. When the water stars to simmer, with a wooden spoon create a vortex in the pot and gently drop the egg in the middle. Let it cook for maximum 3 minutes. Once the egg white becomes opaque, take it out and place on a paper towel to extract the excess moisture. Repeat for the other egg. After eggs are cooked. Take your fresh toasted bread and spread the avocado mash. On top place the poached eggs. Optional: you can add extra protein with some cooked bacon. Serve with diced tomatoes for some extra freshness. Enjoy!"
