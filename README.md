# Phase 1 Project
Welcome to Paul's Cooking Blog - a demo website designed to inspire you with some delicious recipes

# Small Introduction 
Cooking! This has become a hobby and a great passion of mine ever since I joined university. If I can remember well, I was always attracted to the kitchen, but never really leaned into it as growing up in the countryside the boys were not expected to spend time cooking. That for sure changed once I left home and mommy's boy had to learn how to cook in order to survive. It became such a relaxing activity that I enjoy doing daily. Picture this: I sometimes bake cookies in order to snap from monotony! The proof is right here. The pictures used to present each recipe are provided by myself and you can find more on my cooking Instagram account: [paulxcooks](www.instagram.com/paulxcooks).

# Curriculum help
This website was constructed inspired from:
[Toy Tale lab](https://learning.flatironschool.com/courses/5649/assignments/207816?module_item_id=479146)
[Dog CEO](https://learning.flatironschool.com/courses/5649/assignments/207717?module_item_id=479144)

# Layout and Functionality
The recipes along with the pictures are stored inside the `db.json` file. To access this data using the JSON server please run `json-server -- watch db.json`.
In an additional terminal tab open `index.html` in the browser and take a look at the page. 

When the page has loaded, you will first see a container with a photo of me and a small introduction story about my passion for cooking. Below this container, you'll encouter 3 buttons, each designed for a type of meal: breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

Once you press on a `button`, an `event listener` will create a new `div container` for each option with the correct recipes using a `filter` method. The recipe will be presented as a card containing a photo as a presentation, the title, the ingredients and a brief description for the cooking instructions.

Each button has a `hover` CSS property changing the color for a more pleasing aestethic. 

At the bottom of the page, there is a `form` with a `submit` option to collect email addresses for a weekly newsletter.
